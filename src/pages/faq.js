                            <Answer>There is an optional Â£8 per person cover charge which is added to the bills of guests who areseated during the performances. The cover charge we collect goes towards the fixed performance fees we pre-agree with each musician that plays.</Answer>

                            <Answer>Yes, that's why we make the cover charge optional.</Answer>
